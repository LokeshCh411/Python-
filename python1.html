                    <h2>What is Python?</h2>
                    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
                    <p>It is used for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web Development</li>
                        <li>Software Development</li>
                        <li>Mathematics</li>
                        <li>System Scripting etc</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Good to Know</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
                            However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</li>
                        <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated 
                            Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
                        <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
                        <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
                    <p>
                        Python has no command for declaring a variable. <br></p>
                        <p> A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <code>
                            x = 5  <br>
                            y = "John"<br>
                            print(x) <br>
                            print(y) 
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <code>
                            x = 4       # x is of type int <br>
                            x = "Sally" # x is now of type str <br>
                            print(x)                   
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Get the Type</h2>
                    <p>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.</p>

                    <h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>
                    <p>
                        In programming, data type is an important concept. </p>

                       <p> Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>

                        <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text Type:	str</li>
                        <li>Numeric Types:	int, float, complex</li>
                        <li>Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range</li>
                        <li>Mapping Type:	dict</li>
                        <li>Set Types:	set, frozenset</li>
                        <li>Boolean Type:	bool</li>
                        <li>Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
                        <li>None Type:	NoneType</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Getting the Data Type</h2>
                    <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>

                                x = 5 <br>
                                print(type(x))

                    <h2>Python Numbers</h2>
                    <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>int</li>
                        <li>float</li>
                        <li>complex</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <code>

                    <h2>Type Conversion</h2>
                    <p>You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:</p>

                    <h2>Python Conditions and If statements                </h2>
                    <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equals: a == b</li>
                        <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
                        <li>Less than: a < b</li>
                        <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
                        <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
                        <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
                    <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>If statement :</p>
                        <code>
                            a = 33 <br>
                            b = 200 <br>
                            if b > a: <br>
                            <span>print("b is greater than a")</span>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Elif</h2>
                    <p>The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <code>
                            a = 33 <br>
                            b = 33 <br>
                            if b > a: <br>
                            <span>print("b is greater than a")</span> <br>
                            elif a == b: <br>

                    </div>
                    <p>In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".</p>
                    <h2>Else</h2>
                    <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <code>

                            if b > a: <br>
                            <span>print("b is greater than a")</span> <br>
                            elif a == b: <br>

                            else: <br>
                            <span>print("a is greater than b")</span>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".</p>
                    <p>You can also have an else without the elif:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Short Hand If</h2>
                    <p>If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.</p>

                    <h2>Python Loops</h2>
                    <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>

                        <li>while</li>
                        <li>for</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The While Loop</h2>
                    <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>

                    <h2>The For Loop</h2>
                    <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
                    <p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>
                    <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Print each fruit in a fruit list:</p>
                        <code>
                            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>

                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</p>
